title: Building an ontology (part1)
---

<p>I am used to working with semantic web technology, however often the decisions made in some of the ontologies I have seen baffle me. While they are technically correct, they sometimes seem a little <em>strange</em>.</p>
<p>What I realise is that I have not gone through the exercise myself yet. Over the next few months I intend to go through the process of building an ontology, so that I may better understand why things have been done in others that I read.</p>
<p>I will document my progress, and thinking here, to hopefully provide guidance and insight to people who need to do the same in future. </p>
<p>The subject I have chosen for this is “Narrative works.” I would like to create an ontology to describe stories, characters and the relations between them…</p>
<p><em>Actually that could be split in two. One ontology to describe stories and another to describe relations, I may come back to that thought later.</em></p>
<p>Scope</p>
<p>This is difficult to pin down, before I have given too much thought to it. I’ll try and create a user story.</p>
<p>“As a narrative ontology user I would like to be able to describe a story in context so that I can analyse the story and determine facts about it.”</p>
<p>That is still a little woolly. How about some use cases?</p>
<p>Describe (in increasing detail):</p>
<ul><li>A simple fairy tail</li>
<li>A play</li>
<li>Something which has multiple formats eg book of the film.</li>
<li>A TV series</li>
<li>The life of superman.</li>
</ul><p>Determne</p>
<ul><li>The story in chronological order</li>
<li>The story from a characters point of view.</li>
<li>Differences between versions of a story.</li>
<li>Differences between versions of a character.</li>
</ul><p>I may alter the scope as I go, depending on how things pan out.</p>
<p>There is quite a lot of philosophical discussion about <a href="”">naratology</a> which I would study in depth if this were my doctorate, but as I am using this just as an example to try building an ontology I will just dip into the subject as I need to.</p>
