title: Thoughts on internationalization and SEO

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>I am looking at implementation strategies for a website, it has been a while since I have been in i18n land. So I have been doing some research and I am shocked at the state of things.</p>

<p>Web browsers when they request a page send details of the language that they would like to receive it in
<code>Accept-Languageen-us,en;</code>
is what my firefox sends with every request. This tells the server that I would like english content. (us english, but that is another rant). This is part of the core <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4">http standard</a></p> 

<p>What this would mean is that when I go to a website, the server could send back responses that depend on my browsers setting.
<code>http://www.example.com/</code>
Would show english content if I was browsing with an en language set, french if I had fr set and so on. This is a pretty good user experience. That page represents a point in the web graph you would want to link to it from anywhere and not care about the locale of the person reading the link.</p>

<p>So it seems like a nice mechanism to create a multi lingual site, right.</p> 

<p><em>WRONG.</em></p>

<p>Google make this next to impossible. Googlebot dosn't send a accept-language header, which is valid http but it means that you only get one language indexed.</p>

<p>In fact google even <a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=182192#1">states:</a>
<blockquote>
"Keep the content for each language on separate URLs. Donâ€™t use cookies to show translated versions of the page. Consider cross-linking each language version of a page. That way, a French user who lands on the German version of your page can get to the right language version with a single click."
</blockquote>
So they are saying, don't track user preferences via cookies (or headers), they also say that they ignore language codes in a page and guess the language based on the content.</p>

<p>What google would like apparently is:
<div class="codeblock"><code>http://www.example.com/ (shows a language picker page with no content)<br />http://www.example.com/en - shows the english version<br />http://www.example.com/fr - shows the french version<br />etc</code></div></p>
<h4>Why is this bad?</h4>

<p>As a french user I may create  link to the french url, as an english user the english, so even though they have the same equivalent content. A german user may not see a link to the page or may assume there is no german translation because there isn't a link in their language.</p>

<p>Remember Google also doesn't like duplicate content on a website, so you are going against google's own wishes to  do the language dance.</p>

<h4>What can you do about it?</h4>

<p>If you don't care about your alternate languages being indexed then you don't need to do anything, you can use the http header (backed with a cookie preference override). If you have a web app (which won't be indexed) this is not a bad idea.</p>

<p>However a lot of pages do need to be indexed, there you are stuck with language based URLs, there isn't even a language option when creating site-maps.</p>

<p>You can avoid being marked down by google for  duplicate content by using rel-alternate meta tags:
<div class="codeblock"><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;canonical&quot; href=&quot;http://www.example.com/&quot; /&gt;<br /><br />&lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; hreflang=&quot;en&quot; href=&quot;http://www.example.com/&quot; /&gt;<br /><br />&lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; hreflang=&quot;en-gb&quot; href=&quot;http://en-gb.example.com/&quot; /&gt;<br /><br />&lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; hreflang=&quot;en-us&quot; href=&quot;http://en-us.example.com/&quot; /&gt;<br /><br />&lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; hreflang=&quot;de&quot; href=&quot;http://de.example.com/&quot; /&gt;</code></div>
</p>


<p>I don't often have a go at the big G, but in this case I think they have done the web a disservice.</p>
