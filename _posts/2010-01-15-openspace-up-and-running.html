<p>I have the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/openspace">OpenSpace module</a> working and on <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal.org</a>. It is still early days but it could be used by someone with a Drupal site.</p>
<p>The next step is to get it integrated with the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/geo">geo</a> module.</p>
